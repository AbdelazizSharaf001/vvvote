VVVote
======

An Anonymous and Tracable Online Voting System
-----------------------------------------------

VVVote is an online voting system which provides the following features:

- The votes are anonymous. That means, no one can find out which vote came from which voter - except the voter himself. Even the admin of the voting server cannot do this matching.
- The whole process is transparent: every voter can verify that: (a) all votes are unchanged, (b) his vote is counted, (c) only votes from entitled users are accepted.

The system does not provide secrecy in the meaning it cannot ensure that no one looks over the voter's shoulder when voting. And that there is a way for a voter to prove how we decided to vote.
